# Estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals

::: { .notes }
We're going to review some statistical terms, to get ready for discussing hypothesis tests

## Parameters

_Parameters_ are unknown numbers that determine a statistical model

::: { .callout-tip title="A linear regression" }
$$ y_i = a + b x_i $$

- Parameters are:
  - $a$ (the intercept)
  - $b$ (the gradient)
:::

::: { .callout-warning title="A normal distribution representing your data" }
$$ z \sim \textrm{normal}(\mu_z, \sigma) $$

- Parameters are: $\mu_z$ and $\sigma$
:::

::: { .notes }
- Parameters are numbers that you _don't know_ in a statistical model
  - You estimate parameter values from the data you collect
  
- So, if you have a linear regression and are estimating the intercept and gradient in the equation $y_i = a + b x_i$
  - The intercept $a$, and gradient $b$, are the parameters you are estimating
  
- You may be representing the data you collect by a normal distribution
  - This is described by the parameters $\mu_z$ and $\sigma$, which you are estimating from your data
:::

## Estimands { .smaller }

An _estimand_ (or _quantity of interest_) is a value that we are interested in estimating

::: { .callout-tip title="A linear regression" }
$$ y_i = a + b x_i$$

- We want to estimate values for:
  - $a$ (the intercept)
  - $b$ (the gradient)
  - **predicted outcomes at important values of $x_i$**

These are all **estimands**, and **estimates** are represented using the "hat" symbol: $\hat{a}$, $\hat{b}$, etc.
:::

::: { .callout-warning title="A normal distribution representing your data" }
$$ z \sim \textrm{normal}(\mu_z, \sigma) $$

- Estimands are: $\mu_z$ and $\sigma$
  - Maybe you want to determine the 95% confidence interval - **this is also an estimand**
:::

## Standard Errors and Confidence Intervals { .smaller }

- The _standard error_ is the _estimated standard deviation of an estimate_
  - It is a measure of our uncertainty about the quantity of interest


::: { .callout-note }
- Standard error gets smaller as sample size gets larger
  - You know more about the most likely value, the more data/information you collect
  - Standard error tends to zero as sample size gets large enough
:::

- The _confidence interval_ (or CI) represents a range of values of a parameter or estimand that are roughly consistent with the data

::: { .callout-important }
- In repeated applications, the 50% confidence interval will include the true value 50% of the time
  - A 95% confidence interval will include the true value 95% of the time
:::

::: { .callout-tip }
- The usual 95% confidence interval rule of thumb for large samples (_assuming a normal distribution_) is to take the estimate $\pm$ two standard errors
:::

::: { .notes }
- Now I've mentioned confidence intervals we'll need to talk about them
