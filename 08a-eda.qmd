## The Experiment 1

> We will use NONcNZO10/LtJ mice (JAX) to represent a polygenic form of diabetes. Mice in the treatment group will receive a single subcutaneous injection of drug A (up to 30mg/kg). Mice in the control group will receive a single subcutaneous injection of vehicle. Mice will be randomly assigned to receive either drug A or vehicle only without regard to the sex of the animal. 48 hours after administration of drug or vehicle, the blood glucose level will be measured.

## The Experiment 2

::: { .callout-tip title="Our beliefs about the experiment" }
- We are testing the effect of a new drug - drug A - on plasma glucose levels
  - There is a single experimental variable of interest: whether drug A is present (treatment) or absent (control)
  - The plasma glucose level is our outcome measure
- Our experimental subjects are diabetic (NONcNZO10/LtJ) mice
- We will divide individuals into two groups, by different pharmacological treatment
  - Group 1 will receive the vehicle with no active drug (the control)
  - Group 2 will receive the vehicle, containing active drug (the treatment)
- Individuals will be allocated to each group randomly, by complete randomisation
- We are not testing for the effect of sex on drug performance as an experimental variable of interest
  - We are only monitoring for the effect of sex on drug performance as a nuisance factor
:::

## The Experiment 3

::: { .callout-note title="Causal relationships in the experiment" }
Plasma glucose level is potentially dependent on three causal relationships

1. The pharmacological effect of drug A
2. The pharmacological effect of the vehicle
3. Individual differences between experimental subjects (mice)
:::

::: { .callout-important title="Non-causal effects" }
Plasma glucose level is potentially also dependent on other factors including

- sex
- time the drug is administered

Some of these may be systematic and important (_nuisance variables_), and others random and not so important ("noise")
:::

## The Experiment 4

::: { .callout-tip title="Treatment _vs_ no treatment" }
The causal influence of administering drug A (or not) on plasma glucose levels of the experimental subjects is the central reason for performing the experiment

- Presence or absence of drug A is our **independent variable** (aka **explanatory variable**)
:::

::: { .callout-tip title="Independent variables" }
The presence/absence of drug A is an independent variable as whether it is administered or not is entirely under our control, as experimenters.
:::

## The Experiment 5

::: { .callout-important title="Control _vs_ treatment groups" }
**We cannot administer the drug in isolation!**

Like most drugs, drug A is carried in a _vehicle_ - a substance expected to be inert in the contect of the treatment.
:::

::: { .callout-tip title="Controlling for variables" }
It would be unwise to assume we could administer drug A _alone_ to one group of mice and apply no intervention in the other group.

Physiological responses may be affected by:
- the vehicle
- the procedure (e.g. injection)

So we **must** follow the same protocol in the control and treatment groups, with the only variable being presence/absence of drug A.
:::

## The Experiment 6

::: { .callout-tip title="Random assignment to groups" }
Individual mice may respond differently to drug A, the vehicle, and the procedure, due to underlying differences between them.

We therefore need to **randomise** subjects into experimental groups, assuming that _all individuals are drawn from the same population_ (a single pool whose response varies according to some common distribution).

- This means we expect the underlying plasma concentrations, and responses to treatment, in each group to be comparable.
- **Differences in measured outcome between groups are then expected to derive only from our experimental interventions and presence/absence of drug A**
