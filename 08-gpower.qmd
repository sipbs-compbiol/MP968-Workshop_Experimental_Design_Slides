# `G*Power` Walkthrough

## `G*Power`

- `G*Power` is a powerful software tool that can compute several types of power calculations for a very wide range of statistical analyses (@Faul2007-le)

::: { .callout-note }
It is beyond the workshop scope to consider all the possible uses of `G*Power`.

We will only be introducing you to basic operation of the program.

## The Experiment 1

> Is the average weight of ten mice statistically different from 25g?

::: { .callout-tip title="Which statistical test?" }
- Means of real value measurements like height, weight, tend to follow a normal distribution. **A $t$-test may be appropriate**
- We are testing the mean of a sample against a single hypothesised (null) value, so a **one-sample $t$-test** would be the appropriate variant
- We want to know if the sample mean is different from the single hypothesised (null) value and are not concerned with direction, so we would use a **two-tailed test**

## The Experiment 2

> Is the average weight of ten mice statistically different from 25g?

::: { .callout-tip title="What do we want to know from the power calculation?" }
We want to determine an **appropriate sample size** for our experiment, given an expected effect size, variance, and choices of power and statistical significance threshold
:::

## The Experiment 3

> Is the average weight of ten mice statistically different from 25g?

::: { .callout-tip title="What kind of power calculation should we perform?" }
We want to calculate an appropriate sample size for our experiment _before_ we perform it, so we require an **_a priori_ power calculation**
:::

## The Experiment 4

> Is the average weight of ten mice statistically different from 25g?

::: { .callout-tip title="What statistical power should we use?" }
We will use standard funders' requirements of 80% power at $P < 0.05$

$$\alpha=0.05, \beta=0.2, 1-\beta=0.8 $$
:::

## The Experiment 5

> Is the average weight of ten mice statistically different from 25g?

::: { .callout-tip title="What is the expected effect size and variation in the sample?" }
There are no absolute values, but we will make the following assumptions

- A 10% difference in weight from the expected 25g null would be meaningful, for an **effect size of 2.5g**
- We assume that the weight of individuals in the sample has a **standard deviation of 1.25g**, so $\sigma = 1.25$

## Let's start!

::: { .callout-note }
We now have enough information to calculate an appropriate sample size
:::

::: { .callout-tip title="parameters" }
- two-tailed, one sample $t$-test
- _a priori_ power calculation to compute required sample size
- $\alpha = 0.05$
- Power $1 - \beta = 0.8$
- Effect size = 2.5
- Standard deviation, $\sigma = 1.25$
